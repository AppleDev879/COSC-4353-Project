# COSC-4353-Project

Each team member has done a different part of the project, see top folders.

For the Login Form I used styled components, react icons, and framer motion. All backend is included in the JWT folder. For backend I used Express with Express Validator (for validation), made JWT tokens for authenticating users, and Bcrypt for storing hashed passwords. Unit tests and env files not yet created but soon to come.
